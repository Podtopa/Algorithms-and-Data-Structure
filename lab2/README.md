## Linked List

### In this laboratory work I needed to do the following tasks:

* Make a copy of the linked list. 
* Sort the linked list items in descending order.
* We have two linked lists containing the name of the students and the number of examination tickets. Determine the number of tickets drawn by students.
* We have two linked lists containing a list of goods and names of buyers. Every N-th buyer buys an M-th commodity. Display a shopping list.
